# vim-liveunittest

Liveunittest runs your tests and indicates which lines passing and failing tests pass through.

So far it only supports python tests with the unittest library


## Dependencies
- vim with python3 support
- python modules coverage, sortedcontainers

## To Do
- Add option to test on every write
- Decide what to do when tests error rather than fail - i.e. is the user in the middle of typing
- Add support for other unit test modules
